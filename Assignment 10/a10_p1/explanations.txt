When I comment out "using namespace std" in both testcritter.cpp and critter.cpp
I get the following problems:
- identifier "string" is undefined
- identifier "cout" is undefined
- identifier "endl" is undefined
- identifier "cin" is undefined
- too few arguments in function call
- declaration is incompatible with "void Critter::setName"

All the commands that are shown as undefined are defined in namespace std,
so as I removed it, the commands are not identified now.
It also shows that in the function getline there are too few arguments because
the parameters are undefined.
There is also a problem in "void Critter::setName" as string is undefined.

In order to solve these problems I write before all these words std::
So - std:: string
   - std:: cin
   - std:: cout
   - std:: endl

I removed "Critter::" in "void Critter::setHunger(int newhunger)"
I get this problem:
- identifier "hunger" is undefined
This happens because the variable hunger is declared as private in critter.h 
In order to solve this problem,declare hunger as a public variable in critter.h.
Also remove the function void setHunger(int newhunger) from critter.cpp
and put and call this function in testcritter.cpp.
